I've taken some time out from coding to write about one of my favourite pieces of software: Internet Explorer 6! This ancient piece of software is still going strong; over the years, it has repeatedly proven itself to be the best browser available. I mean, it's been around since 2001 - it's proven technology!

As a web designer (sometimes), I also believe that IE6 is the superior browser - throughout the years it has taught me many things, such as patience and perseverance. Also, it removes the need to test stuff in other browsers - I only ever test my designs in IE6 (if it works in IE6, it'll work in everything else). It's great at rendering important things like content instead of stupid and unnecessary bells and whistles such as border radii and gradients. Who uses them, anyway?

It was already installed when I bought my computer and it hasn't yet given me any reason to upgrade. The Internet hasn't changed very much, and it hasn't given me too many viruses. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.

The interface is excellent. It doesn't have too many buttons like these newfangled browsers like Firefox and Chrome, but isn't too tricky to use like my old favourite, lynx. Also, I love the logo! I like the way it doesn't have tabs. They're a waste of space and Alt+Tab is easier by far.

In conclusion, I don't understand why people are abandoning this great piece of software. I suggest that you all go and download it right now, it'll bring back some of the best memories of your lives.

On an unrelated note, happy April Fool's Day!
