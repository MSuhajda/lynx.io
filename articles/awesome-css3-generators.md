CSS3 generators make a web developer's life so much easier, particularly if you don't use the properties very often. Here, I have gathered some of my favourite generators:

**[Border-Radius.com](http://border-radius.com/)**

This is the CSS3 generator that I visit the most often. This is incredibly useful, providing a quick and easy way to generate border-radius properties. The address is very easy to remember and the design is very simple and minimalistic, and you can choose the browsers that you want to support at the bottom. You can set the different corners to different values, and your code updates in realtime.

**[Layer Styles](http://www.layerstyles.org/builder.html)**

Layer Styles allows you to generate the code for drop-shadow,  inner-shadow, background, border and border-radius, providing a realtime view of your changes. The interface will be familiar to most people, particularly designers. The code it produces supports Webkit browsers (Chrome, Safari), Firefox, Opera and newer versions of Internet Explorer.

**[CSS Gradient Generator](http://www.colorzilla.com/gradient-editor/)**

This tool generates CSS3 background gradients. This tool has a _huge_ 137 presets that you can use to get started,  and the code that this tool generates is compatible with more versions of Internet Explorer than [Layer Styles](http://www.layerstyles.org/builder.html), using filter properties as a fallback. Optional IE9 support is included, however this requires that you place some browser-specific code on your page. This tool is also designed to look like a program that I'm sure most of you are familiar with.

**[CSS3Generator.com](http://www.css3generator.com/)**

While CSS3Generator isn't the prettiest of sites that we have listed, it is certainly the most functional. It generates code for the most properties out of all of the services listed here. It supports border-radius, box-shadow, text-shadow, RGBA, @font-face, multiple columns, box-resize, box-sizing, outline, transitions, transform, selectors and gradients.
