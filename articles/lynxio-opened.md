summary: I'm happy to announce that after a few weeks of work, lynx.io is finally open. It has a better design, is on a different server, and is far faster than the old site. It also features a lot more client-side logic, as opposed to the old website where everything was server-side.

I'm happy to announce that after a few weeks of work, lynx.io is finally open. It has a better design, is on a different server, and is far faster than the old site. It also features a lot more client-side logic, as opposed to the old website where everything was server-side. It was a fairly long process; I developed the site from scratch, and had to convert 40 or so articles from HTML to MarkDown. I did use a few libraries, a couple of which I will be writing articles on as I couldn't find any good existing articles or documentation. lynxphp, the old site, has now been completely shut. The design was shocking, the amount of spam that WordPress attracted was unbearable, and the name wasn't appropriate as it had ceased to be exclusively about PHP and was just about general web development (personally, I am no longer a PHP developer - I am now a front-end developer with a specialism in JavaScript).

It is also a lot easier to write for lynx.io - instead of signing up, having me (Callum) add you as a writer, writing your article through the horrible WordPress interface, and then having to contact me to approve it, you can now just write your article and send a pull request through the lynx.io repository on GitHub.

The new lynx.io website is open source, and you can find it [here](https://github.com/callumacrae/lynx.io/). Feel free to fix any bugs you find / make some improvements, you will get credit for anything you contribute.

Thanks for reading, and enjoy the new lynx.io!

P.S: For the next month (until the end of August), I'll be paying $25 per high-quality article (high-quality is by my own discretion). I may continue afterwards, it depends how well it works and how much money I have left. Check out the [about page](http://lynx.io/about) page to see how information on how to write for lynx.io, and for topics we look for.
