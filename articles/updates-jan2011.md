Two weeks ago, on the 1st of January '11 at 01:01:01, lynxphp opened. As lynxphp has been more successful than I first hoped, I've made a few changes:

* We have developed a pastebin. It is still in beta, so please report any bugs you find. <s>You can find it here</s> nope, we killed it!
* We have introduced a Top Articles widget in the sidebar. It is calculated by amount of visits (excluding mine and Parkzer's). It is currently being updated by hand, so it could potentially be out of date.
* We've introduced a CAPTCHA. Sorry. The good news is that it's a "Conditional CAPTCHA"; it only displays if Akismet flags the comment as spam, meaning that genuine users shouldn't see it (Akismet currently has an >99% accuracy rate at lynxphp).
* We now have an editor, [Parkzer](http://parkzer.com), who will be revising articles as needed.

We have now also ran out of prewritten articles, so we will not be publishing daily as we were - we will be publishing one every one or two weeks.

Some visitor statistics for over the last two weeks:

* Over the last two weeks, we have had 20 seconds of downtime, and that was my fault (I accidentally told the server to display all errors to see what would happen, and one of the plugins isn't very well coded).
* We have had 450 unique visitors so far, and an average of 50 unique a day, meaning that people are coming back.
* Including spiders, we have had over 4,500 pageviews.
* The most read article is "Preventing and Dealing with Spam in phpBB", with 260 visits.
* The browser that visited us most is Firefox, and the operating system that visited us most is Windows 7, with 592 and 522 visits respectively.
* The bot that visited us most (with 716 visits) is Yahoo Slurp, but the search engine we got most referrals from is Google, with 34 referrals.

Thank you for supporting lynxphp, if you have any suggestions or requests for articles, please leave a comment on this post or use the contact form.
