Welcome to lynxphp! I’m Callum Macrae, administrator of lynxphp and a PHP developer. I’ve been around for a while, but I’ve never actually contributed anything to the developer community, so I thought I would start this website to share my knowledge (and to help myself learn new stuff)! I will attempt to provide useful information and tutorials about PHP, in addition to other generic web topics like server management and third-party scripts. I probably won’t be writing any articles about front end development (HTML, CSS, Javascript, etc.) because I much prefer backend development. (Sorry!)

There is one thing I will never teach anyone, and that is how to say “Hello World!”. For a start, I’m going to assume you know the very basics of PHP, and I also only give real-life examples.

Over the next week or so, I will be attempting to publish an article daily. Okay, that’s not quite as impressive as it sounds – I have loads already saved to drafts that I did while I was buying the domain! When I’ve run out of saved articles, I will hopefully be writing about one weekly.

Until next time!

~Callum

**UPDATE**: Okay, I may have strayed from this a little bit; the site is no longer exclusively about PHP (I'm not even a PHP developer any more). It's not even called lynxphp any more. Updates on this soon…
