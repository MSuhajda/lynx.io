*lynx.io* was founded by Callum Macrae in 2011 with the aim of providing web developers with a good and reliable source of information, tutorials and tips. On it, you can find articles on a variety of topics, including articles on PHP, JavaScript, development infrastructure, patterns, and third party scripts like CodeIgniter and phpBB. We take requests - if you would like to see an article, just contact us and if we like it, we'll write about it.

lynx.io was not named after a certain text-based web browser, it was named after the mythical creature. A little quote from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynx_(mythology)):

> The Lynx is an elusive, ghost-like animal that sees without being seen. [â€¦] The Lynx teaches us that even the smallest can succeed in life, and that the world can unfold itself to those who stop and listen.
